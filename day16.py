# Python Operators
# Operator is a symbol that perfoms operations on operand
# Expression (a+b)
a = 2
b = 3
print(a+b)
print(a==b)
print(a<b)
print("\n \n")

# Create two variables num1 and num2 with values 10 and 5 respectively.
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
# Addition: Add num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable named add_result.
add_result = num1+num2
# Subtraction: Subtract num2 from num1 and store the result in a variable named sub_result.
sub_result = num1-num2
# Multiplication: Multiply num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable named mul_result.
mul_result = num1*num2
# Division: Divide num1 by num2 and store the result in a variable named div_result.
div_result = num1/num2
# Exponentiation: Raise num1 to the power of num2 and store the result in a variable named exp_result.
exp_result = num1**num2
