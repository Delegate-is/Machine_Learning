Farm Produce Marketplace (Django Prototype)
This is a simplified Django project that demonstrates how to build a dashboard similar to the one in the provided image.

Getting Started
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.

python --version

pip --version

Create a Virtual Environment: It's best practice to work in a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Django:

pip install django

Create a Django Project:

django-admin startproject marketplace .

Create a Django App:

python manage.py startapp dashboard

Configure the Project: Open marketplace/settings.py and add the dashboard app to INSTALLED_APPS.

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps
    'dashboard',
]

Add the App's URLs: Open marketplace/urls.py and include the URLs from your new dashboard app.

from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    # ... other urls
    path('', include('dashboard.urls')),
]

Create the urls.py file for the dashboard app: In your dashboard directory, create a new file named urls.py and add the content from the urls.py file provided below.

Create the models.py and views.py files: Update the dashboard/models.py and dashboard/views.py files with the code provided below.

Create the templates directory: Inside the dashboard folder, create a new folder called templates. Inside templates, create another folder called dashboard.

Create the dashboard.html template: Inside the dashboard/templates/dashboard folder, create a file named dashboard.html and add the content from the dashboard.html file provided below.

Run Migrations: This step creates the database tables based on your models.py.

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Run the Server:

python manage.py runserver

View the App: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You should see the dashboard.
